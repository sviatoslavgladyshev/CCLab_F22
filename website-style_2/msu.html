      <p class="description">
        The main building of Moscow State University was erected in 1949â€“1953 by architects L.V. Rudnev, S.E. Chernyshev, P.V. Abrosimov, A.F. Khryakov, V.N. Nasonov, and others. The strictly symmetrical structure of the complex corresponds to the pyramidal silhouette of the structure, dominating the ensemble of university buildings surrounding it. The main building of Moscow State University includes several faculties, a scientific library, a museum, the administration, a grand assembly hall, a club part with an auditorium, a swimming pool, dormitories, teachers' apartments, canteens, shops and household services.<br>

<br>In front of the building there is an extensive parterre with fountains, ending with a wonderful observation deck, from where a beautiful view of the city opens.<br>
