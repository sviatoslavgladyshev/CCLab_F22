      <p class="description">
        Moscow often became an object of art, turning out to be the heroine of works, or accepting elements of decor - temporary, festive, or permanent, sometimes curious, sometimes pompous.<br>

<br>With the advent of Soviet power, the city was urgently equipped with new-made monuments erected in memory of relevant, in the opinion of the new government, historical figures. To this day, only a few artifacts have survived from these monuments, since the ruin of the country and the urgency of the installation exceeded the need to raise funds for high-quality materials.<br>

<br>During the Stalinist Empire style, the metro became the face of the city - an underground high-tech temple open to all residents of Moscow and the Soviet Union. It was the most democratic, popular City of Kitezh, recessed like the usual Moscow, where each station had its own concept and was decorated using expensive, presentable materials. The metro was often displayed in the works of artists of the Soviet period, and in general, the transport theme should have been conducive to the mood of the holiday and emotional upsurge.<br>

<br>In 1957, the VI World Festival of Youth and Students visited Moscow, which certainly adorned it and turned many ideas, in particular, about art. Many young artists visited the international exhibitions arranged within the framework of the festival, which helped them to adjust for themselves variations and opportunities for self-expression.<br>

<br>In 1974, Moscow becomes a kind of exhibition hall, arranged at the intersection of two streets - this event will go down in the history of Russian art under the name Bulldozer Exhibition. Among its organizers will be the founders of the famous Sots Art, which will deconstruct and recontextualize socialist realism and the entire Soviet way of life, including the entire social propaganda industry.<br></p>
