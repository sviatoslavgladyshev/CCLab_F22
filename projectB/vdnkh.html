      <p class="description">
       The Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy is the largest exposition, museum and recreational complex in the world. Since the opening on August 1, 1939, the name has changed several times - VSHV, VDNKh of the USSR, VVTs. Today, VDNKh is a unique space for museum and exhibition projects, international business exhibitions and congresses, festivals and holidays.<br>

<br>The All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, which eventually received the name VDNKh, became an architectural masterpiece of the era of socialist realism and socialist imperialism, which has not yet been properly appreciated. Some, if not many, of the pavilions are perfect creations, unique monuments that reflect the spirit and essence of that ideal and perhaps unattainable world of true freedom, equality and fraternity that they were supposed to symbolize.<br>
